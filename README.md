# giphies
## Instructions to run the app
Clone the repo, `cd giphies` and run `npm install && npm start` or `yarn install && yarn start`.
You'll need to create your own `.env` file and add your Giphy api key to it. Your `api key env variable` must be `REACT_APP_GIPHY_KEY` in order for the api call to work.
Your `.env` file should look something like this `REACT_APP_GIPHY_KEY=7fh9y4h` where `7fh9y4h` is your api key.
That's it!
